### [Assignment 1](/teaching/csc485-f24/a1): Dependency Parsing

This assignment is designed to familiarize you with classic tasks while utilizing the latest cutting-edge methods. You will build neural dependency parsers using various algorithms. You will become familiar with parsing and learn the fundamentals of working with neural models using PyTorch. 

### [Assignment 2](/teaching/csc485-f24/a2): Word Sense Disambiguation and Language Models Interpretation

In the first part of the assignment, we will explore various Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms, ranging from the Lesk algorithm to BERT. You will gain familiarity with semantics and hands-on experience with large-scale transformer models.
Then, in the second part of this assignment, you will explore the current advancements in understanding how language models work and what occurs within them. 

### [Assignment 3](/teaching/csc485-f24/a3): Building Grammar Rules: Symbolic Machine Translation

In this assignment, you will learn how to write phrase structure grammars for some different linguistic phenomena in two different languages: English and Chinese. You can use the two grammars to create an interlingual machine translation system by parsing in one and generating in the other. You will use this case study to analyse a very interesting linguistic phenomenon --- the quantifier scoping difference between the two languages.

## Course Policies

### Prerequisites

- Mandatory: `CSC209` and `STA237/247/255/257`.
- `CSC311` and `CSC324/384` are strongly recommended.
- Engineering students may substitute `APS105`, `APS106`, `ESC180` or `CSC180` for the `CSC209` requirement, although experience with the Unix operating system is strongly recommended, and/or `ECE302`, `STA286`, `CHE223`, `CME263`, `MIE231/236`, `MSE238`, `ECE286` for the statistics requirement.

<Callout type="error">
The University's automatic registration system checks for prerequisites: even if you have managed to register for the class, you will be dropped from it unless either you had satisfied the prerequisite before you registered, or you received a prerequisite waiver.
</Callout>

### Evaluation Policies
There will be three assignments, some quizzes and no final exam. For CSC 2501 students, there will also be 5 essays to write based upon assigned readings.

| Component             | CSC485   | CSC2501  |

<Callout type="error">
    No late assignments will be accepted except in case of documented medical or other emergencies.
</Callout>

### Remark Requests
Requests for remarking an assignment must be made within **seven (7) days** of the return of the marked assignment via the remark request online form (link TBA).

Requests for remarking will be reviewed by the head TA or instructor if deemed necessary, consult with the grading TA, who originally mark the assignment. If the grading TA determines that the original grade was too high, the student's grade may be lowered.  If the grading TA determines that the original grade was too low, the student's grade will be adjusted accordingly.
Once all the remarks are completed, they will be released back to the students.  The decision on the remark will be final and no further requests for a remark will be considered.
Any or all other departmental and university policies on remarking applies as well.

### Policy on Collaboration, Online Resources, AI Writing Assistance and Plagiarism
Collaboration on and discussion of quiz content is encouraged. No collaboration on homeworks or essays is permitted. The work you submit must be your own. No student is permitted to discuss or share homeworks with any other student from either this or previous years.

Posting solutions, materials, or handouts from assignments, quizzes, or essays to any public forum (including but not limited to Reddit, GitHub, and GitLab) is strictly prohibited. The use of any unauthorized online materials is also forbidden. Submitting any code or writing that is not your own constitutes an academic offence.

The use of AI writing assistance (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc) is allowed only for refining the language of your writings. You can use generative models for paraphrasing or polishing the you original content rather than for suggesting new content. Submitting any code generated by any AI assistants is strictly prohibited. The only exception is when you are specifically instructed to evaluate the behaviour and performance of these LLM models, in which case the models' output must be clearly distinguished from the rest of the report.

Failure to observe this policy is an academic offence, carrying a penalty ranging from a zero on the homework to suspension from the university. See [Academic integrity at the University of Toronto](https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/).
