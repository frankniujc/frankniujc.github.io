# Homework Submission Steps

In the homework for Intro2LLM (25/26), we use Google Colab to create HW tasks. Students finish the tasks there and submit the finished Colab file to Moodle for grading.

Get access to the HW and make a copy

## Finish the tasks on Colab

Finish the tasks by filling code in the area between `## YOUR_CODE_STARTS_HERE` and `## YOUR_CODE_ENDS_HERE`. Don't forget to run all the cells after finishing the task. We will mainly use the output of the cell marked by `## RESULT_CHECKING_POINT` to do grading.
