# Homework 2: Retrieval with TF-IDF / BM25 / LSA, Word2Vec (CBOW), and MAP Evaluation

Colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PcQiQZ0YrkuloSokpMq2WSpQ7LXPqc-l?usp=sharing

### This homework has three tasks:
(1) Ranked retrieval with TF-IDF, BM25, and LSA (Truncated SVD) on a sampled subset of 20 Newsgroups — 6 pts
(2) Word2Vec (CBOW) with PyTorch trained on the same sampled subset — 7 pts
(3) Mean Average Precision (MAP) implementation + evaluate LSA vs CBOW on the test split — 7 pts

**BONUS:** Solve any task with an LLM — **2 pts**

Please complete all tasks in the provided [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PcQiQZ0YrkuloSokpMq2WSpQ7LXPqc-l?usp=sharing).  
Work through each section carefully, following the instructions and filling in the required code or explanations where prompted.

Once you finish:
- Please make sure your notebook is fully executed before you submit it. Even if you copied the starter notebook, you should run all cells (Shift+Enter) so the outputs are visible.
- Download your completed notebook as a `.ipynb` file.  
- Submit the file via the course submission portal.  
- Double-check that all your results and written answers are saved before uploading.
