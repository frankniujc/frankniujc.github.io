# Working on the `teach.cs` Server

## Table of Contents

## Your `teach.cs` Account

Everyone registered in this course should have access to `teach.cs` account and `teach.cs` server. If you have not already done so, please get an account following [the instructions](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/resources/how-do-i-get-an-account/).

## SSH and VSCode Setup

You can connect to `teach.cs` servers using SSH (secure shell) following [these instructions](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/using-labs/remote-command-line-ssh/).

VSCode provides an easy integration with SSH. You can follow the steps here to set up your VSCode to connect to teach.cs server. These steps mostly follow [the official document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).

1. Install VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you haven't done so.
2. Install a supported open-ssh client following [the instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting) according to your system. After the installation, make sure that typing ssh in your terminal gives the following output:
    ```bash
    usage: ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface]
               [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port]
               [-E log_file] [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11]
               [-i identity_file] [-J [user@]host[:port]] [-L address]
               [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec] [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port]
               [-Q query_option] [-R address] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port]
               [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] destination [command]
    ```
    If not, restart your computer and try again.
3. Install the Remote-SSH extension for VSCode.
4. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or clicking on the top search bar and type in `>`), select `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...`
5. In the new prompt, type in `username@teach.cs.utoronto.ca`. Press enter, type in your password and press enter again.
6. You might need to select the platform type for remote. Choose `Linux`.
7. Once you are connected, you can open any folder by clicking on Open Folder on the left panel, See Figure 1 for an example layout. The default folder is your root folder. You can select your A1 folder to get started.

8. You can open the terminal by following [the introduction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics).

## How to Connect to a Remote Terminal Using SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote terminal over a network. It encrypts the connection to protect data in transit.

Here's an introduction on how to connect to a remote terminal using SSH:

- **Basic Syntax:**  
   The basic command to connect to a remote server is:  
   ```bash
   ssh your_username@teach.cs.toronto.edu
   ```
- **Connecting from Linux and Mac:**  
   - Open the terminal.
   - Use the command:  
     ```bash
     ssh your_username@teach.cs.toronto.edu
     ```
   - Replace `your_username` with your `teach.cs` username.
- **Connecting from Windows:**  
   - Use PowerShell or Command Prompt (Windows 10+ supports SSH natively).
   - Type:  
     ```bash
     ssh your_username@teach.cs.toronto.edu
     ```
   - Alternatively, use an SSH client like [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/):  
     - Enter `teach.cs.toronto.edu` in the "Host Name" field.
     - Click "Open" to connect.

### Advanced Setup

Here are instructions to set up the `.ssh/config` file, generate an SSH key, and add the SSH key to the `authorized_keys` on a remote server. These steps will help you configure SSH for easy and secure access to remote servers -- you will no longer need to enter your password every time you try to connect.

1. **Set Up `.ssh/config` File:**
   - Create or edit the `.ssh/config` file in your home directory:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.ssh/config
     ```
   - Add configuration details for your remote hosts:
     ```bash
     Host wolf
         HostName teach.cs.toronto.edu
         User your_username
     ```
   - Now, you can connect to the cluster with this simplified command:
     ```bash
     ssh wolf
     ```
2. **Generate an SSH Key Pair:**
   - Follow GitHubâ€™s instructions to generate a new SSH key pair:  
     [GitHub SSH Key Generation Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
   - After generating the key, you will have a public key (`id_ed25519.pub`) and a private key (`id_ed25519`).
3. **Copy the Public Key to the Remote Server's `authorized_keys`:**
   - Use `ssh-copy-id` to add your public key to the `authorized_keys` file on the remote server:
     ```bash
     ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub your_username@teach.cs.toronto.edu
     ```
   - Alternatively, manually copy the contents of your public key to the remote server:
     - Display your public key with:
       ```bash
       cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
       ```
     - On the remote server, append this key to the `authorized_keys` file:
       ```bash
       echo "your-public-key" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
       ```
     - Ensure correct permissions:
       ```bash
       chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
       chmod 700 ~/.ssh
       ```
4. **Set Permissions for the `.ssh/config` File:**
   - To ensure security, set the correct permissions for your `.ssh/config`:
     ```bash
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
     ```

## Moving Files to `teach.cs` with `scp`

SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) is a command-line utility for securely transferring files between local and remote machines using SSH (Secure Shell).

Here's an introduction on how to use `scp` to move files to a remote directory:

1. **Basic Syntax:**  
   The basic syntax for transferring files to a remote server is:  
   ```bash
   scp [options] source_file your_username@teach.cs.toronto.edu:remote_directory
   ```
2. **Example Command:**  
   To copy a file named `example.txt` to a remote directory `~/csc485/a1` on `teach.cs.toronto.edu`, use:  
   ```bash
   scp example.txt your_username@teach.cs.toronto.edu:~/csc485/a1
   ```
3. **Copying Directories:**  
   Use the `-r` option to recursively copy directories:  
   ```bash
   scp -r a1_starter_codes your_username@teach.cs.toronto.edu:~/csc485/a1
   ```
- The application [`rsync`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/238152/why-is-scp-so-slow-and-how-to-make-it-faster) is a faster alternative to scp, but it is only available on Linux.

## Using GPUs

The Teaching Labs have a small computing cluster equipped with GPU. See [these instructions](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/using-labs/cluster/) on how to use them.
